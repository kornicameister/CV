      Apart from being generally fond of OpenSource Software, I have been given a chance to contribute to
      emerging solution in the cloud monitoring solution - monasca.
      With, and thanks to, Fujitsu, I am the part of the team aiming to create LaaS (Logging as a Service) solution.
      My contribution, reviews and code, is mainly visible in the monasca projects.
      Also I created three applications, both released under Apache license.

      My biggest pride is monasa-log-api, that Python implementation has been written by me from the scratch.
      Project received a positive feedback from the community and is now a part of, so called,
      OpenStack Big Tent along with the rest of monasca projects.
      My involvement can be tracked at:
